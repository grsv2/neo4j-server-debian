# Need to create neo4j's own directory to track the pid since the daemon is not run as root 
# and doesn't have permission to write the pid to /var/run (which would be the preferred location).

# Store neo4j log file in it's own directory since they can become rather large and in the future
# rotating logs can be easily added.
